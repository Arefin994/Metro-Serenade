# Welcome to another episode of i make random games

One night, I suddenly got the idea to make a visual novel. After some searching, I found a few resources and gathered some assets (it wasn't easyâ€”there are hardly any free resources out there). I ended up creating the Kirin character myself!

This project is just a test demo for now, but who knows? Maybe a bigger visual novel will come later. Have plan to make one with my friend.

I put together the assets and wrote around 300 lines of code. It's not the greatest visual novel ever, but hey, it works! 

It bearly have 2 mins of gamplay lol. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
